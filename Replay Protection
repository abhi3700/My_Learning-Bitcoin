For instance, Alice transfers 0.1 B to Bob, then that transaction is reflected on the main chain as well as the other chain like Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Segwit2x (BSWT). This is a problem. Right?
That's why using 'Replay Protection', a transaction visible on chain X will not be reflected on chain Y.

Two types of Replay Protection (RP)- 
A. Strong 2-way RP - 
        # transactions from chain X are never valid on chain Y.
        # transactions have some marker which clearly indicates what chain they are intended for. E.g. In BCH, this was achieved through marking the signatures, which every transaction requires.
        # E.g. it is like an automatically locking door that prevents the transaction from escaping chain X.
        
B. Opt-in RP - 
        # transactions from chain X need to do something to be invalid on chain Y.
        # E.g. it is more like a door you have to remember to lock, because otherwise the transaction may escape chain X and get into chain Y.

Example: 
Recently, in Bitcoin Segwit2x, it is mentioned that there is no 'replay protection'. This means that the transactions happening with the B2X coins on the new blockchain might take place with the BTC there in Bitcoin network.
They are not taking any corrective measure and the exchanges will have to take the responsibility for any coin's loss.
