For instance, Alice transfers 0.1 B to Bob, then that transaction is reflected on the main chain as well as the other chain like Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Segwit2x (BSWT). This is a problem. Right?
That's why using 'Replay Protection', a transaction visible on chain X will not be reflected on chain Y.

Two types of Replay Protection (RP)- 
A. Strong 2-way RP - 
        # transactions from chain X are never valid on chain Y.
        # transactions have some marker which clearly indicates what chain they are intended for. E.g. In BCH, this was achieved through marking the signatures, which every transaction requires.
        # E.g. it is like an automatically locking door that prevents the transaction from escaping chain X.
        
B. Opt-in RP - 
        # transactions from chain X need to do something to be invalid on chain Y.
        # E.g. it is more like a door you have to remember to lock, because otherwise the transaction may escape chain X and get into chain Y.
